## Description:
This project aims to bridge the digital divide for elderly individuals by providing them with easy access to ChatGPT through voice interaction. Many elderly individuals may face challenges with typing, which can limit their ability to engage with AI-powered chatbots like ChatGPT. To address this barrier, our Voice-Text AI Bot enables elderly users to interact with ChatGPT using only their voice, eliminating the need for navigating to the chatgpt website, typing and using its elder-unfriendly interface. This enhanced accessibility for elderly individuals improves their digital inclusion by providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for interacting with AI technologies. We believe in leveraging cutting-edge technologies to create positive social impact and empower individuals of all ages to benefit from the advancements in artificial intelligence.

## Key Features:
Voice Interaction: Elderly users can communicate with the AI bot using their voice, making it accessible and user-friendly.
Translation: The bot translates the user's voice commands into English before processing them, ensuring seamless communication with ChatGPT.
Text-to-Speech: Responses generated by ChatGPT are converted into speech using AWS Polly, allowing elderly users to hear the bot's responses.
Natural Language Understanding: AWS Comprehend is employed for natural language understanding, enabling the bot to interpret and analyze user queries accurately.
Medical Assistance: Integration with Med7 ensures that the bot can understand and respond to medical-related queries with accuracy and reliability.


## Technologies Used: (subject to changes)
Chat Model: Text-Davinci-003, a powerful language model developed by OpenAI, is utilized for generating responses to user queries.
Text-to-Speech: AWS Polly is leveraged for converting text responses into natural-sounding speech.
Natural Language Understanding: AWS Comprehend is employed for extracting insights from user queries and understanding their intents.
Medical Integration: Med7 is integrated to enable the bot to understand medical terminology and provide relevant responses to health-related queries.

## How to Use:
Simply activate the bot and start speaking your query or message.
The bot will translate your voice input into English and process it using ChatGPT.
You'll receive a spoken response from the bot, thanks to AWS Polly.
Enjoy seamless communication with ChatGPT .

## Files

In the root folder, you can type in `npm start`
which will run the chat bot interface that will be shown to the elderlies. 

In this webpage, the elderlies will be able to speak into it and a voice will talk back to them.

Behind the scenes, with the conversation data collected, we used AWS Comprehend to detect sentiment throughout the conversation and relay extremely negative conversations back to the workers. 

Additionally, we also used Med7, a python-based AI library that is effective in detecting medication related data throughout the conversation.
