I didn't have a good night's sleep.
I had a bad nights dream.
And when I woke up today, my knees hurt. Could you recommend me anything for that?
I have thoughts of deaths nowadays, since I am old.
I feel like death is just around the corner.
Maybe some therapy and a simple dosage of Panadol might help for now.
